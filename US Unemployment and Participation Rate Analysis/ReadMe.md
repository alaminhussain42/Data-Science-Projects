# US Unemployment and Participation Rate Analysis

## Project Overview

This project leverages the `fredapi` library to analyze and investigate unemployment and labor force participation rates across various US states. By utilizing data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API, this analysis aims to provide insights into regional economic conditions and labor market dynamics.

## Objectives

- Investigate and visualize unemployment rates across different US states.
- Examine labor force participation rates and their trends.
- Analyze correlations and patterns between unemployment and participation rates.

## Dataset and Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API, which provides access to a wide range of economic data series. Specifically, the datasets include:

- **Unemployment Rate**: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking employment.
- **Labor Force Participation Rate**: The percentage of the working-age population that is either employed or actively seeking employment.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- **`fredapi`**: Python library for accessing the FRED API to retrieve economic data.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

## Methodology

1. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Use `fredapi` to fetch unemployment and participation rate data for different US states from the FRED API.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values and ensure data consistency.
   - Format data for analysis and visualization.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Calculate key statistics and trends for unemployment and participation rates.
   - Compare data across states and identify significant patterns.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations to represent unemployment and participation rates.
   - Use charts and graphs to highlight trends and correlations.

## Key Findings

- **Unemployment Trends**: Observed variations in unemployment rates across states and identified states with the highest and lowest rates.
- **Participation Rate Analysis**: Analyzed labor force participation rates to understand regional differences and trends.
- **Correlations**: Explored correlations between unemployment rates and participation rates to identify potential economic patterns.
