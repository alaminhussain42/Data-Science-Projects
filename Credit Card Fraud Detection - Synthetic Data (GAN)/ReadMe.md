# Credit Card Fraud Detection - Generating Synthetic Data Using GANs

## Business Scenario
Company X is seeking to enhance the accuracy of their fraud detection system, which currently relies on a binary classifier. The model's performance is hampered by data imbalance, as fraudulent transactions are significantly rarer than legitimate ones. To address this issue, we will employ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic fraudulent transactions that closely mimic real ones. This strategy aims to balance the dataset and improve the accuracy of the fraud detection model.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to use GANs to generate synthetic fraudulent transaction data. By augmenting the existing dataset with these synthetic samples, we aim to:
- Address the class imbalance issue.
- Improve the performance of the fraud detection model.
- Enhance the modelâ€™s ability to detect fraudulent transactions with greater accuracy.

## Approach

### 1. **Data Understanding and Preparation**
   - **Dataset**: The dataset comprises historical credit card transactions, with features indicating various transaction details and a binary label indicating fraud.
   - **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize features, and split the data into training and validation sets.

### 2. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
   - **GAN Architecture**: Implement a GAN consisting of a Generator and a Discriminator. The Generator creates synthetic fraudulent transactions, while the Discriminator evaluates their authenticity.
   - **Training**: Train the GAN to generate high-quality synthetic fraud samples that are indistinguishable from real transactions.

### 3. **Synthetic Data Integration**
   - **Data Augmentation**: Integrate the generated synthetic data with the original dataset to balance the class distribution.
   - **Model Training**: Train the fraud detection model on the augmented dataset to enhance its performance.

### 4. **Evaluation**
   - **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the performance of the fraud detection model using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.
   - **Comparison**: Compare the performance of the model trained on the original dataset versus the augmented dataset to assess improvements.

## Results
The project aims to demonstrate:
- The effectiveness of GAN-generated synthetic data in balancing the dataset.
- Improvements in the accuracy and reliability of the fraud detection model.
- A detailed analysis of performance metrics pre- and post-data augmentation.

## Conclusion
By employing GANs to generate synthetic fraudulent transactions, this project addresses the challenge of data imbalance in fraud detection systems. The enhanced dataset is expected to lead to more accurate and reliable fraud detection, providing Company X with a robust solution to improve their existing system.

## Technologies Used
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: For generating synthetic data.
- **Python Libraries**: TensorFlow/Keras for implementing GANs, Pandas, NumPy for data processing.

## Future Work
- **Model Optimization**: Further refine the GAN model to improve the quality of synthetic data.
- **Additional Techniques**: Explore other data augmentation techniques and advanced models for fraud detection.
- **Scalability**: Implement and test the approach on larger datasets and in real-time fraud detection systems.
