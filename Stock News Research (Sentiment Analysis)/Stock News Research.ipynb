       "(\"The artificial intelligence trade has been losing its luster as of late  Shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), three of AI’s biggest players, are down over the last month, with Google parent Alphabet dropping 14%, Amazon off about 8%, and Microsoft falling more than 7% as of Thursday  The stock moves come after the companies, along with fellow hyperscaler Meta (META), confirmed they’ll continue to pour billions of dollars into building out their AI infrastructure over the coming quarters — without providing much insight into when they’re going to turn all of that spending into revenue  That, along with the recent market turmoil, has put a damper on AI company stocks  But the most important component of the AI trade, Nvidia (NVDA), still has to report its earnings  The chip company’s performance could turn around the AI trade more than any hyperscaler  Unlike those software firms, revenue hasn’t been a problem for Nvidia  Still, if it falls short of Wall Street’s already sky-high expectations, it could bring the AI trend down with it  Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft’s AI spending might be giving investors pause, but it’s helping pad Nvidia’s bottom line  The company’s Hopper AI chips are the most sought-after on the market, and the firm is set to begin ramping up production of its Blackwell line later this year  The company controls 80% to 95% of the market for high-powered AI chips, according to Reuters  That means every time a company says it's spending on AI capabilities, chances are it’s buying up, or at least using, Nvidia’s processors  But Nvidia’s second quarter report also marks the start of what will be several quarters of difficult year-over-year revenue growth comparisons  The company’s fiscal Q2 2024 revenue came in at $13 5 billion, up 101% year over year  Data center revenue topped $10 3 billion, up 141%  Each subsequent quarter has seen ever more impressive year-over-year gains for the chip giant  But that party won’t last forever  In its most recent quarter, Nvidia reported revenue of $26 billion, a 262% increase from the $7 19 billion the company reported in the prior year  For its upcoming second quarter report, Wall Street analysts are anticipating revenue of $28 6 billion, a 112% year-over-year jump  And while that still represents an enormous increase in revenue, it’s not as staggering as the growth the company has seen in its previous quarters  And that could turn off some investors  That’s not to say Nvidia isn’t expected to continue raking in cash, or that Wall Street is down on the company  As of Thursday, 66 analysts had Buy ratings on Nvidia’s stock  Just seven had Hold ratings and only one had a Sell rating  It’s safe to say Wall Street has confidence in the company’s outlook\",\n",
       " ' After all, as UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri pointed out in a recent investor note, semiconductor manufacturer TSMC, which produces Nvidia’s chips, posted strong quarter-over-quarter results in its high-performance computing segment  That should indicate another potentially stellar quarter for Nvidia is in the offing  Nvidia, unlike software companies, also benefits from the fact that its products have a real tangible benefit for its customers now  Hyperscalers are putting the company’s chips to work as fast as they can to develop and power AI models  But AI-powered software is still in a foggy kind of testing phase  Companies are implementing AI enterprise software, but it’s not as though its impact on their employees’ productivity will skyrocket overnight  What’s more, experts say it’ll still take years for AI-powered software like Microsoft’s Copilot or Google’s Gemini to truly pay off for business customers  And while those companies are busy iterating on their products, Nvidia will keep on selling them its hardware  So, while the AI trade may have taken a hit over the last month, its biggest winner will continue powering forward  Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance com  Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley  For the latest earnings reports and analysis, earnings whispers and expectations, and company earnings news, click here Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance  Sign in to access your portfolio')"
