# SQL Analysis of Chicago Datasets

## Project Overview

This project aims to practice solving generic problems using SQL by analyzing three datasets sourced from the City of Chicago's Data Portal. The analysis addresses various questions and insights based on the following datasets:

1. [Chicago Public Schools](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t): Performance data for CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year.

2. [Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2): Socioeconomic indicators and a "hardship index" for each community area in Chicago from 2008 to 2012.

3. [Chicago Crime Data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2): Reported incidents of crime in Chicago from 2001 to the present (excluding the most recent seven days).

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to apply SQL to answer various questions based on these datasets. By doing so, the project enhances skills in querying, data manipulation, and analysis.
